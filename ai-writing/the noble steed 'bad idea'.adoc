# the noble steed 'bad idea'

The stable master sighed deeply as she watched Lady Eleanor mount her prized stallion. "My lady, perhaps today you might consider riding... literally any other horse?"

Eleanor gathered the reins of her massive black destrier, adjusting her seat in the saddle. "Nonsense, Margaret. Bad Idea is the finest mount in the kingdom."

As if to punctuate her statement, Bad Idea chose that moment to rear magnificently, causing Eleanor's circlet to slip askew. The horse's hooves crashed back to earth with enough force to scatter the stable cats.

"See?" Eleanor beamed, straightening her circlet with one hand while Bad Idea pranced sideways through a freshly raked pile of hay. "Such spirit! Such presence!"

Margaret pinched the bridge of her nose. "The horse ate three fence posts yesterday."

"He was testing their structural integrity," Eleanor replied with dignity, right before Bad Idea decided to bolt through the courtyard at full gallop, scattering a group of visiting diplomats like startled pigeons.

Margaret could have sworn she heard her lady laughing as horse and rider disappeared through the castle gates.

## Original prompt

> write a short scene which includes a noble steed named 'Bad Idea'

## Commentary

The juxtaposition of a genteel noblelady sitting atop what one presumes to be a ferocious, psychotic stallion going buck-wild is quite funny. This is also where I first learned the word 'destrier'.
