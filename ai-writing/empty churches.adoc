# empty churches

Dr. Sarah Blackwood knelt in the soft earth beside Saint-Étienne's church, her trowel scraping gently against the limestone of what appeared to be the oldest grave marker in the yard. The late autumn sun cast long shadows through the bare branches above, and her breath fogged in the cold air as she worked.

Three weeks into the excavation, and everything about the 12th-century church had been textbook—until now. She'd already documented the expected architectural features: the remnants of original Norman arches, fragments of early Gothic modifications, and the usual traces of village life in the surrounding soil layers.

The first empty grave had seemed like an anomaly. Medieval grave robbery wasn't uncommon, after all. But as her team methodically excavated the second, third, and fourth plots, a pattern emerged that made her skin crawl. Each grave had been properly dug, lined with stone where the family could afford it, and filled in with soil—but not a single human bone remained in any of them.

"Professor?" Her graduate student Thomas called from the newest test pit. "You need to see this."

Sarah brushed the dirt from her knees and made her way over. Thomas pointed his flashlight beam at the perfectly preserved outline of a wooden coffin that had long since rotted away. The soil showed clear evidence of decomposition, but like all the others, there wasn't so much as a tooth or finger bone to be found.

"How many is that now?" she asked, though she already knew the answer.

"Twenty-three," Thomas replied. "All empty. And look at this." He handed her a small brass buckle, green with age. "Found it right where the chest would have been. They weren't robbed—the grave goods are still here. It's just the bodies that are missing."

Sarah stared up at the church's weathered spire. The setting sun had painted it a bloody red, and for the first time in her career, she felt a deep reluctance to continue digging. In all her years of fieldwork, she'd never encountered anything like this: an entire graveyard of empty graves, as if the dead had simply gotten up and walked away.

"Pack it in for today," she said quietly. "And bring the ground-penetrating radar tomorrow. I want to know if there's a single occupied grave in this entire churchyard."

As they gathered their tools in the growing darkness, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that the church itself was watching them, its ancient stones holding onto a secret that perhaps should remain buried.

Sarah spent the next morning in the church archives, poring over parish records while her team systematically scanned the grounds. The Latin texts were fragmentary, water-damaged in places, but something in a tithe record from 1342 caught her eye—an unusually high purchase of salt and iron nails by the church, listed alongside the more typical expenses for wine and candle wax.

She was making notes when Thomas knocked on the archive door.

"The radar results are... strange," he said, unrolling a printout across a dusty table. "See these deeper anomalies? They're all around the church foundation, about eight feet down. Some kind of trenches, but they don't match any construction phase we've documented."

Sarah traced the pattern with her finger. The trenches formed a perfect circle around the church, intersecting with what appeared to be the original foundation.

Later that afternoon, she was cleaning a collection of recovered grave goods when she noticed something peculiar about a silver crucifix found in one of the empty plots. The back had been filed to a point, sharp enough to draw blood. Not decorative work—this had been done crudely, with purpose.

"Dr. Blackwood?" One of her undergraduate students approached, holding a soil sample bag. "We found something unusual in the medieval layer. The soil has an extremely high copper content, but only in thin bands around where the bodies would have been."

Sarah thought of the green stains she'd noticed on several coffin nails—she'd assumed it was normal oxidation, but copper-doped soil wouldn't explain that pattern. She made a note to run a more detailed chemical analysis.

As the sun set, she stood in the church doorway, examining the worn stone threshold. The deep grooves she'd initially attributed to centuries of foot traffic had an odd pattern to them. They were deepest at the edges, as if something had been repeatedly laid across the threshold—perhaps chains or heavy rope, worn away long ago but leaving their mark in the stone.

None of these details proved anything conclusively. But as Sarah updated her site journal that evening, she found herself writing around the edges of a possibility that seemed too fantastic to name—yet somehow felt more plausible than any conventional explanation she could devise.

## Original prompts

The above is a stitching-together of the outputs to these prompts:

> I'd like you to write a scene about an archaeologist excavating a Medieval French church, only to realise that all of the graves in the attached graveyard are empty

> Let's continue with them finding some understated clues which point towards the graves being empty because of vampirism back in the Medieval era. I really do want these clues to be understated, and for the scene to have a sense of verisimilitude.
