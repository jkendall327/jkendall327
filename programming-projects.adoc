= Programming projects

This page lists some of the programming projects I did for fun before I started working with software in a professional capacity. I keep this listing up primarily for historical interest.

Everything here was made with .NET/C#.

I'm not including various minor toy apps I've made just to learn specific concepts as they're not interesting to look at. The projects here are all things I made because I needed or wanted them.

== Octans

This is a WIP image management system heavily inspired by [the Hydrus Network](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/index.html). While I love that app, I find it rather slow and clunky. I decided to recreate it as a deliberately extravagant goal - a Serious App I could cut my teeth on architecturally. It has been a fun ride so far. As time goes on, I question the client/server split I made (both do server-style work, the distinction is between the 'core' database activities and everything else).

One thing I'm proud of is the levels of code quality I've kept to here. I have ratcheted up the static analysis as far as I can, got formatting verified in CI, full integration tests, the whole works. Unsurprisingly, it makes it far easier to actually get things done without breaking stuff!

== Civitai Firehose

After we got into using Blazor at work, I became enthralled at how easy it made making real web apps; not having to deal with the nightmarish JS frontend ecosystem was a real boon. As such I started up this app as a side project.

The motivation was enjoying the endless stream of cool AI images on Civitai, and wanting a live view that let me quickly save and organise them. This involved a lot of playing around with Civitai's API, including some of its annoying edge-cases (like JSON properties which change shape for seemingly arbitrary reasons!).

The code quality here is only mediocre, but it was fun to quickly develop a web app that actually served a practical use to me.

== QuietTime

I https://github.com/jkendall327/QuietTime:[describe this project on GitHub] as 'f.lux for your ears'. It's a WPF app that automatically caps your computer's volume. I made it for two reasons:

* Preventing long-term hearing damage, which I was worried about
* Stopping my new bluetooth headphones from maxing out my volume randomly

QuietTime was my first attempting making an app with 'all the bells and whistles' -- logging and DI from day one, clean architecture, keyboard shortcuts, a responsive UI, formal releases, etc. My hope is that someone else out there in the world might actually find it useful, so I held myself to a high standard of quality.

I'd like to improve it further with unit testing, localisation and UI theming, but it's currently feature-complete.

== WallpaperMaker

This app https://github.com/jkendall327/WallpaperMaker:[converts an image of arbitrary size into a 1920x1080 jpg] suitable for a desktop wallpaper.

It currently fills out the side panels by taking a random snapshot of the main image. I might change this in future.

My big weakness is web stuff, so I made this ASP.NET Core webapp as a learning experience.

Pages are served with Razor, image conversion through a backend API in the same project.

Frighteningly, it also includes a little JavaScript.

This is in active development. My plan is to try making a proper UI in one of the big three JS frameworks (probably Angular).

== dotnet explanations

OK, this technically isn't a programming project.

Over the past few months I've created https://github.com/jkendall327/dotnet-explanations:[a simple static site with clear, plain-English explanations] of tricky .NET and C# concepts.

Almost all tutorials I've found online focus too rigidly on the mechanics of programming rather than making appeals to intuition. 

To counter that, I try to always foreground what problem a particular language feature or technology is meant to solve, and avoid jargon.

== UK Tax Calculator

Since I left my retail job I've been link:writing-portfolio.html[working as a freelance copywriter]. 

I recently filed for my first self-employed tax return, which inspired me to make an app that would help the process along.

The result was https://github.com/jkendall327/UK-Tax-Calculator:[a simple CRUD app that stored transactions, calculated their total and your outstanding tax]. 

The tax calculation was very simple and not suitable for real use, but I'm quite happy with the UI, which is a combination of two NuGet packages.

This was my first project working seriously with databases (I used SQLite), which was very instructive.

== DupFinder

image::images/dupfinder.png[]

I have a lot of holiday photos taking up space on my PC, so I'm always searching for a good heuristic near-duplicate finder for images. 

I'm not satisfied with any currently existing solution, so https://github.com/jkendall327/DupFinder:[I made my my own].

I made this before I got really comfortable with WPF, so the UI isn't spectacular, but it does showcase some async work and interesting ways of comparing image data.
